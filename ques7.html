			<td><h2><u>Solution:</u>No. The novel Coronavirus that causes the Covid-19 infectious disease cannot spread through insects, stray dogs and cats or house pets. Respiratory transmission is the primary and dominant mode of transmission and it is an infection that spreads through droplets when a person sneezes or coughs. That is the reason people have been advised to maintain social distancing of 1 metre or more because sneeze and cough droplets and micro particles do not travel more than a distance of a metre or more.</h2></p></td>
