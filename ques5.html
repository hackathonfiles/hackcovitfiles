			<td><h2><u>Solution:</u>First, we should all understand and accept that this is unusual, and we're all in this together. You are not alone. There are therapists out there who are conduting online sessions. They all agree that mental health is going to take a toll, especially if you already deal with depression or anxiety. They suggest a number of coping mechanisms: Reach out. Call your friends. Develop a routine. Give journaling a try. Cook. Paint.
		Remember that your mental health is as important as your physical health. And if you have to take care of your mind. So, this may be a time for social isolation but it does not mean mental or emotional isolation. Reach out to friends, family regularly. Be empathetic, this is the time we should show a lot more kindness that we usually do.
