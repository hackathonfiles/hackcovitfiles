			<td><h2><u>Solution:</u>With regards to hospitalisation, those with symptoms have to place a call to a government helpline (depending on the state) and a medical team is supposed to come and check the symptoms. However, hospitalisation is decided based on mildness or severity of symptoms. If a person has mild symptoms and has tested negative, they can be simply put in a quarantine in a hospital or they can also be recommended home isolation. But they have to be monitored closely. A person who tests positive and has advanced symptoms has to be admitted to an isolation ward.</h2></p></td>
